**MNIST Detection**
The MNIST dataset is a widely used benchmark dataset in the field of machine learning and computer vision. It consists of a collection of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9) along with their corresponding labels. The goal of this project is to train an ANN model to accurately classify these digits.
